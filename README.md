# Crazy-Chess NJIThack
## This is a chess interacive website where players can play online chess
*But here is a twist !! This chess is treacherous and it betrays ! Red Rackham and his pirates have attacked Sir Francis Haddock's ship The Unicorn. Help our captain to save The Unicorn by a game of chess. But there's a deal Red Rackham wont play regular chess according to the rules of warfare. Since he is a pirate he will use his own version of crazy chess!*
> Here every piece has an affinity which makes it double the fun. Chess pieces change colour from black to white and vice versa midgame reversing the winning chances once it crosses 0.
